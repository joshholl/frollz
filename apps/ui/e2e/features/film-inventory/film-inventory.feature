Feature: Film Inventory
  Users create film records and advance lifecycle state transitions through the UI.

  Background:
    Given I am authenticated as "demo@example.com"

  Scenario: Add a purchased film from the inventory page
    When I add a film named "Portra Test Roll"
    Then I see "Portra Test Roll" in the film table
    And the film state badge for "Portra Test Roll" is "Purchased"

  Scenario: Record storage and load transitions
    Given a camera exists for loading named "Canon AE-1"
    And a purchased film exists named "Lifecycle Roll"
    When I open film detail for "Lifecycle Roll"
    And I record the film as stored in "Freezer"
    And I record the film as loaded into device "Canon AE-1"
    Then I see the film current state "Loaded"

  Scenario: Film form requires required fields
    When I try to submit film with missing required fields
    Then I see a film form validation message containing "Name, emulsion, format, and package are required"

  Scenario: Unauthenticated users are redirected from film inventory
    Given I am not authenticated
    When I navigate to "/film"
    Then I am redirected to the login page

  Scenario: Add film form disables dependent fields until a format is chosen
    Given I have opened the add film form from the unfiltered inventory
    Then the emulsion and package type fields should be disabled

  Scenario: Add film form filters options once a format is chosen
    Given I have opened the add film form from the unfiltered inventory
    When I select the format "35mm"
    Then only emulsions compatible with "35mm" should be available
    And only package types compatible with "35mm" should be available

  Scenario: Add film form pre-filters options when opened from a filtered inventory
    When I open the add film form from the inventory filtered to "35mm"
    Then the format field should be locked to "35mm"
    And only emulsions compatible with "35mm" should be available
    And only package types compatible with "35mm" should be available
