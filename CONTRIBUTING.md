## Getting started

1. **Fork** the repository on GitHub
2. **Clone** your fork locally
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/frollz.git
   cd frollz
   ```
3. **Activate the pre-commit hook** (required — mirrors CI exactly)
   ```bash
   git config core.hooksPath .githooks
   ```
4. **Copy the environment file**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   The defaults in `.env.example` work for local development.

---

## Development setup

Install dependencies and run the monorepo in watch mode:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts:
- `@frollz2/api` — NestJS API on port 3000
- `@frollz2/ui` — Vite dev server on port 5173

The UI dev server proxies `/api` requests to the API service automatically.

If you want the production-like container stack locally, use:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

### Running tests and lint locally

**API**:
```bash
pnpm --filter @frollz2/api test
pnpm --filter @frollz2/api lint
```

**UI**:
```bash
pnpm --filter @frollz2/ui test
pnpm --filter @frollz2/ui lint
pnpm --filter @frollz2/ui check-types
```

The pre-commit hook runs all of the above plus a Semgrep SAST scan automatically before every commit. If the hook passes, CI will pass.

## Editor setup

### VS Code (recommended)

The repo ships a `.vscode/` directory with settings, extension recommendations, and tasks pre-configured for this stack.

#### Recommended extensions

Open the command palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) → **"Extensions: Show Recommended Extensions"** to install the full set in one click. The key extensions and what they do:

| Extension | Purpose |
|---|---|
| **Vue - Official** (`vue.volar`) | Vue 3 language server — type-checking, template intellisense, inlay hints |
| **ESLint** (`dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`) | Auto-fixes lint errors on save |
| **Vitest** (`vitest.explorer`) | In-editor test runner — pass/fail gutter icons and a test sidebar panel |
| **Turbo Console** (`ms-vscode.vscode-turbo`) | Run turbo tasks from the command palette; visualise the task dependency graph |
| **Playwright** (`ms-playwright.playwright`) | E2E test runner UI and interaction codegen |
| **Pretty TypeScript Errors** (`yoavbls.pretty-ts-errors`) | Renders raw TypeScript error output as readable prose |
| **DotENV** (`mikestead.dotenv`) | Syntax highlighting for `.env` files |

#### What the workspace settings do

- **Format on save** is enabled. TypeScript and JavaScript files use the VS Code built-in formatter; Vue files use Volar; JSON files use the built-in JSON formatter.
- **ESLint auto-fix on save** runs alongside formatting to catch lint violations (unused imports, consistent type imports, Vue template rules).
- **`dist/`, `coverage/`, and `.turbo/`** are excluded from both the file explorer and search results so generated output stays out of your way.
- **Workspace TypeScript** — VS Code will prompt you to switch to the workspace version of TypeScript (hoisted to `node_modules/typescript/lib` by pnpm). Accept the prompt or set it manually via `Cmd+Shift+P` → **"TypeScript: Select TypeScript Version"** → **"Use Workspace Version"**.
- **Volar inlay hints** — missing required props and inline handler event types are shown inline in templates.

#### Tasks

`Cmd+Shift+B` runs the default build task (`dev: all` — starts both the API and UI in watch mode via Turborepo).

`Cmd+Shift+T` runs the default test task (`pnpm test` across all packages).

All other tasks are available via `Cmd+Shift+P` → **"Tasks: Run Task"**:

| Task | Command |
|---|---|
| `dev: all` | `pnpm dev` — API + UI in parallel watch mode |
| `check-types` | `pnpm check-types` — full monorepo type check |
| `lint` | `pnpm lint` — ESLint across all packages |
| `test` | `pnpm test` — all Vitest suites |
| `ui: e2e` | Playwright end-to-end tests |
| `db: migrate` | Apply MikroORM migrations |
| `db: seed` | Run the idempotent reference data seed |

#### Other editors

JetBrains IDEs (WebStorm / IntelliJ) work well with this stack out of the box — enable **Volar** (or the bundled Vue plugin in recent versions) and configure ESLint to use the flat config at the repo root. No `.idea/` config is committed to keep the repo editor-agnostic.

## Making changes

### Branch from `development`

All work branches from `development`, not `main`. `main` tracks the latest release.

```bash
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name   # or fix/your-fix-name
```

### One concern per PR

Keep pull requests focused. A PR that fixes a bug and adds a feature is harder to review and harder to revert if something goes wrong. Split unrelated changes into separate PRs.

### Tests

All new code should have unit tests. If you're fixing a bug, add a test that would have caught it. If you're adding a feature, cover the happy path and the key failure cases.

Test files live alongside the code they test:
- API: `apps/api/src/<module>/<module>.spec.ts`
- UI: `apps/ui/src/<feature>/<feature>.spec.ts`

### Database changes

Schema changes should include a migration in the driver-specific directory:
- SQLite: `apps/api/src/infrastructure/migrations/`
- PostgreSQL: `apps/api/src/infrastructure/migrations-postgres/`

Use the existing timestamped pattern: `MigrationYYYYMMDDHHmmss.ts`. Never modify a migration that has already been merged.

## Submitting a pull request

1. Push your branch and open a PR against the `development` branch (not `main`)
2. Fill out the PR template — describe what changed and how you tested it
3. All CI checks must pass before a PR can be merged
4. A maintainer will review your PR; please respond to feedback promptly
5. Once approved, a maintainer will merge it

**Please wait for review before merging.** We don't auto-merge PRs.

## Coding conventions

The codebase follows a consistent set of patterns — please match the style of the surrounding code.

### Backend (NestJS)

- Each domain resource is a self-contained module: `module / controller / service / dto / entities`
- All database access goes through `DatabaseService` — never import a database client directly
- DTOs use `class-validator` decorators for validation
- Services return typed entity objects; controllers return those directly (NestJS serializes them)
- Row mappers (`mapX(row)`) translate snake_case DB columns to camelCase TypeScript fields

### Frontend (Vue 3)

- All HTTP calls go through `src/services/api-client.ts` — views never call fetch/axios directly
- Views are per-domain and live in `src/views/`
- Shared UI components go in `src/components/`
- Use the Composition API (`<script setup>`) — not the Options API

### General

- TypeScript strict mode is on — no `any` unless genuinely unavoidable
- Prefer explicit over clever — readable code over terse code
- No console.log in committed code
